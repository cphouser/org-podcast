* org-podcast

A tiny parsing script for rendering an rss feed for a podcast from an org-mode file. This can be used in conjunction with org-mode's HTML exporting which can render the same document as a catalog of episode notes and direct links. 

** Setup
Configuration is all done in =feed-config.yaml=. Structure of the org document is described and exampled in =index.org=. =feed-render.py= can be invoked in the same directory as feed-config.yaml without any arguments.

Requires:
- Emacs (recommended)
- Python 3.6 or later
- [[https://github.com/karlicoss/orgparse][orgparse]]
- [[https://github.com/svpino/rfeed][rfeed]]
- [[https://pyyaml.org/][pyYAML]]
